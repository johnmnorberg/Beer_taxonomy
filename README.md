# Beer taxonomy

An interactive beer taxonomy chart using Python based off the 2015 Beer Judge Certification Program (BJCP) guidelines. The data was formatted in Excel by Lucas Zacharias and was pulled from the BJCP website. I provided minor edits for the output of my visualization. (https://www.bjcp.org/stylecenter.php)

Dependencies: plotly.graph_objects, networkx, pandas, matplotlib.pyplot, and numpy

Shout out to Boerderij_Kabouter for providing the color scheme. (https://www.homebrewtalk.com/threads/ebc-or-srm-to-color-rgb.78018/)
